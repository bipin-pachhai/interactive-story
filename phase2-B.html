    <div class="introduction">
    <p>
        The phase two progresses based on the answer <b>"NO"</b>. As you have not been connected to your Neighbor's network before, we need to
        crack it alternatively. 
</p>
    <h2>Here are the couple of methods you can apply to crack the network's password. </h2>

            <li>
                <a href="bruteforce.html"><span><b>Brute-Force:</b></span></a><p>
                    Brute-force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password. As the password's length increases, the amount of time,
                   the computational power required on average, to find the correct password increases exponentially.

                    Phishing is a type of social engineering attack we will use here to steal login credentials of your Neighbor's network. 
                    It works when we sent a spam link on the text message asking him to enter the login credentials of his Wi-Fi.
