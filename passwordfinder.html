    <h1>Hacking- Phase Two</h1>
    <p id="introduction">
    The phase two progresses based on the answer <b>"Yes"</b>. As you have been previously connected to your Neighbor's Wi-Fi before, one easy way we recommend is to use the program <i>PATHFINDER</i>.
    </p>
    <div class="flexbox">
        <div>
        <h3> ABOUT PATHFINDER:</h3>
        <p id = "about"><code>Pathfinder comes handy when you have the network to which you have already logged in and entered the password in the past.<br>
                The program can also help show  SSID (Service Set IDentifier), Password, Authentication type, Encryption method and Connection type.

        <p id ="explanation"> Before moving to the next phase, we would like to know about the Wi-Fi network's security type. Here is some information about Wi-Fi password security. <br/>
        </p>
            <ol>
           <li> WPA2-AES (the same as WPA2-CCMP)  offer poor security if the password is too short. Nothing can be done to prevent an attacker 
            from capturing network traffic and using a brute force attack to decrypt it off-line, making billions of guesses a second.<br/>
         </li>
           <li> WPA and WPA2 passwords require a minimum of eight characters, eliminating the possibility 
            that users will pick shorter passphrases that could be brute forced in more manageable timeframes.
            WPA and WPA2 also use a network's SSID as salt, ensuring that hackers can't effectively use precomputed tables to crack the code.
        </li>
        </ol>
